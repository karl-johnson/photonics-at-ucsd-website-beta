blurb: >-
  This is one of our favorites. The concept is simple: there are 3 colors of lasers, and players must move around optics to get the lasers where they need to go (see diagram). There are other examples of games similar to this (e.g. [Laser Maze](https://www.lakeshorelearning.com/products/games/logic-games/laser-maze/s/GA104/) and in [Portal 2](https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Thermal_Discouragement_Beam)), but ours has its own distinct feel. The requirement that light go straight into the detectors adds substantial challenge and complexity; the table-top size combined with the form factor of the optics also makes it feel a lot more like aligning "real" optics. Once the pieces have been made for this demo, there are a practically infinite number of puzzles that can be prepared (the diagram shows only one example - we have about 15-20 in our records). Getting the full guide, including CAD models and full build instructions, for this out is one of our top priorities, so check back frequently and it should be here soon!
